Assignment 2 - We will rewrite Intcoll1 and replace the ideology of zero marker and replace it with howmany variable
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//CONSTRUCTOR 1
public Intcoll2{
	c = new int[500];
	howmany = 0;
}

** GET RID OF ZERO MARKERS

//Insert method that collects positive numbers
remove the if (c[j] == 0)
j == howmany -1
howmany++;

2). modify (increase/decrease) howmany
